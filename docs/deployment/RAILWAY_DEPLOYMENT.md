## 🔍 Post-Deployment Verification

### 1. Health Check

Visit: `https://your-app.railway.app/api/health`

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
  "uptime": 123.456,
  "environment": "production"
}
```

### 2. Frontend Access

Visit: `https://your-app.railway.app`

### 3. Admin Panel

Visit: `https://your-app.railway.app/Employee/Admin/ManageUsers`

## 🛠️ Railway CLI Commands

### Useful Commands

```bash
# View logs
railway logs

# View environment variables
railway variables

# Connect to database (if using Railway PostgreSQL)
railway connect

# View deployment status
railway status

# Redeploy
railway redeploy

# View metrics
railway metrics
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Build Failures**
   ```bash
   # Check build logs
   railway logs --build
   ```

2. **Database Connection Issues**
   - Verify database credentials
   - Check firewall settings
   - Ensure database server allows connections

3. **Environment Variable Issues**
   ```bash
   # List all variables
   railway variables
   
   # Set missing variables
   railway variables set VARIABLE_NAME=value
   ```

4. **Port Issues**
   - Railway automatically assigns ports
   - Use `process.env.PORT` in your application

### Debug Mode

```bash
# Enable debug logging
railway variables set DEBUG=*

# View detailed logs
railway logs --follow
```

## 📊 Monitoring

### Railway Dashboard

1. Visit [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Select your project
3. Monitor:
   - Deployments
   - Logs
   - Metrics
   - Environment variables

### Health Monitoring

The application includes a health check endpoint at `/api/health` that Railway uses for monitoring.

## 🔄 Updates and Maintenance

### Deploying Updates

```bash
# Pull latest changes
git pull origin main

# Deploy updates
railway up
```

### Database Migrations

```bash
# Run database migrations (if needed)
railway run npm run migrate
```

## 🚨 Security Considerations

1. **Environment Variables**: Never commit sensitive data to Git
2. **Database Security**: Use strong passwords and enable SSL
3. **JWT Secrets**: Use cryptographically secure random strings
4. **Stripe Keys**: Use live keys only in production
5. **HTTPS**: Railway provides HTTPS by default

## 📈 Scaling

### Railway Scaling Options

1. **Vertical Scaling**: Increase memory/CPU in Railway dashboard
2. **Horizontal Scaling**: Add more instances
3. **Database Scaling**: Upgrade database plan

### Performance Optimization

1. **Enable Caching**: Use Redis for session storage
2. **CDN**: Use Railway's CDN for static assets
3. **Database Indexing**: Optimize database queries
